## What's in the name?

**zenix** = zen + nix

Just like in zen philosophy, where less is more, this configuration aims to be:

- Minimal yet functional
- Simple yet powerful
- Clean yet customizable

And just like the paradoxical zen koans, NixOS might sometimes make you question everything you know about system configuration... but in a good way 🧘‍♂️

_May your builds be pure and your systems reproducible_ 🌸
